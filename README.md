# creatingVM

I created a virtual network diagram to simulate how a companyâ€™s web application would be set up on a physical server. The goal was to use virtual machines and other components to create a secure and efficient system. I started by designing the physical server as a rectangle in Figma, which served as the base for all the virtual components.
I added two virtual machines to the top half of the server. One of these virtual machines will function as the web server, while the other will be the database server. I then placed a third virtual machine toward the bottom of the server to host containers. I made sure to connect these containers to the third virtual machines since they are part of it. It was interesting to see how everything fits together virtually.
Next, I included a firewall to protect the network, ensuring it would be connected correctly to secure the virtual machines and containers. After that, I added a virtual switch to manage the network and assigned IP addresses to the virtual machines. Finally, I connected the physical server to the internet by placing an internet icon outside the server.
This exercise helped me understand how all these virtual components like firewalls, virtual machines and switches work together to host a web application securely. It gave me hands-on experience in designing a virtual network and showed me the importance of each part in keeping the system running smoothly.
